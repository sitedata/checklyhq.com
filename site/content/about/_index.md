# About us

Checkly is a bootstrapped company founded in 2018 and has been growing steadily.  
We are a small team, working from Berlin 🇩🇪 (mostly) but 100% committed to remote work.

Our customers are spread accross the world, from China to Colorado. From Sweden to South Africa.  

- We care about open communication, sharing knowledge and delivering an awesome service.   
- We work on Checkly and open source projects like Puppeteer Recorder.  
- We don't take ourselves too serious; we take our work and our customers very serious.

# We ❤️ open source

We aim to donate 1% of our revenue to non-corporate backed open source maintainers.
